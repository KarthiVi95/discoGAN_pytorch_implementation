<h1> DiscoGAN Pytorch Implementation CSE 676 </h1>

<p> Repo contains PyTorch implementation of the discoGAN paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05192) with some optimizations. Style transfer was done from Horse to Zebra domain and vice versa successfully.

Code was run on a server with 4 Nvidia 2080 Ti GPUs running in parallel for over 200 epochs with 16K iterations per epoch and a batch size of 64</p>
